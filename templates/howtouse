/**
 * Welcome to the "ExtremelyLame" templating engine!
 *
 * To begin, let me introduce you steps of creating your very first
 * template
 *
 * 1) Create a new php file in a "templates" directory
 * 2) Now, you can include your css and js using
 * $css = "/view/style/yourstylesheet.css"
 * $js = "/view/js/yourjsscript.js"
 * 3) To fill in a body, use $body = " whatever tags you want " (but instead of "" use '' format)
 * 4) Include a basic template typing include_once "basic_template.php"
 *
 * Do not forget to incude it in the end of your template.
 *
